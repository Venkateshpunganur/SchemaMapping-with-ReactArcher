These things I have implemented for Dynamic UI:

•	Can drag and drop to draw a connection between source and target.
<br>
•	If type = “text/varchar” have dashed arrow with green color OR type = “integer” has solid arrow with blue color.
<br>
•	DELETE button to delete any mapping.
<br>
•	SAVE button to save the mappings.
<br>
Here I have used the React-archer package and imported Archer Container and Archer Element from the package.


To run the project install React and install dependencies with npm install and enter npm start.
